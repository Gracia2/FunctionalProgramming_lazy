    "\n",
    "What Is Functional Programming?\n",
    ": a programming paradigm based on the evaluation of expression, which avoids changing-state and mutable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is most definitely not a “pure functional programming language. However, Python is a multiparadigm language that makes functional programming easy to do when desired, and easy to mix with other programming styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Functions are first class (objects) :  That is, everything you can do with “data” can be done with functions themselves (such as passing a function to another function).\n",
    "\n",
    "• Recursion is used as a primary control structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "• There is a focus on list processing :  Lists are often used with recursion on sublists as a substitute for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "• “Pure” functional languages eschew side effects :\n",
    "Functional programming either discourages or outright disalows statements, and instead works with the evaluation of expressions (in other words, functions plus arguments)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Functional programming worries about what is to be computed rather than how it is to be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Much functional programming utilizes “higher order” functions : in other words, functions that operate on functions that operate on functions\n",
    "\n",
    "https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/06/08/functional-programming-in-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "• Avoid state representation\n",
    "\n",
    "• Data are immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key motivations beyond Functional Programming, and beyond some of its aspects like no changing-state and no mutable data, is \n",
    "the need to eliminate side effects, i.e. changes in the state that don’t really depend on the function input, making the program more difficult to understand and predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•There is more Functional Programming support in the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. map() reduce() and filter()\n",
    "\n",
    " The functions reduce() and filter() naturally belong together with the map() function. While map will apply a function over a sequence, producing a sequence as output, reduce will apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items in a sequence, in order to reduce the sequence to a single value. The use of filter() consists in applying a function to each item in a sequence, building a new sequence for those items that return true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: the term sequence has to be intended as iterable, and for both map() and filter() the return type is a generator (hence the use of list() to visualise the actual list).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. lambda functions\n",
    " Python supports the definition of lambda functions, i.e. small anonymous functions not necessarily bound to a name, at runtime. The use of anonymous functions is fairly common in Functional Programming, and it’s easy to see their use related to map/reduce/filter.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. itertools module\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Generators for lazy-evaluation\n",
    " \n",
    " Generator functions and generator expressions in Python provide objects that behave like an iterator (i.e. they can be looped over), without having the full content of the iterable loaded in memory. This concept is linked to lazy-evaluation, i.e. a call-by-need strategy where an item in a sequence is evaluated only when it’s needed, otherwise it’s not loaded in memory.\n",
    " \n",
    "• Functional programming can be considered the opposite of object-oriented programming. \n",
    " \n",
    " Objects are little capsules containing some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let you modify this state, and programs consist of making the right set of state changes. \n",
    " \n",
    " Functional programming wants to avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions. \n",
    " \n",
    " In Python you might combine the two approaches by writing functions that take and return instances representing objects in your application (e-mail messages, transactions, etc.).\n",
    " \n",
    "• Functional design may seem like an odd constraint to work under. Why should you avoid objects and side effects? There are theoretical and practical advantages to the functional style:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal provability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of debugging and testing.\n"

    "## Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    " This capability is only loosely connected to functional programming per se, since Python does not quite offer lazy data structures in the sense of a language like Haskell.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, use of the iterator protocol—and Python’s many built-in or standard\n",
    "library iteratables—accomplish much the same effect as an actual lazy data structure.\n"
